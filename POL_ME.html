                <P style="font-size:25px"> Engineering is one of the oldest and broadest engineering branches and hence one of the most preferred one by the students who want to pursue engineering. It is a diverse subject that derives its breadth from the need to design and manufacture everything from small individual parts and device to large complex systems.

                    The role of a Mechanical engineer is to take a product from an idea to the market place. In order to accomplish this a broad range of skills are needed.
                    
                    Mechanical Engineers use the core principles as well as other knowledge in the field to design and analyse motor vehicles, heating and cooling systems, manufacturing plants, industrial equipment and machinery, robotics, medical devices and more.
                    
                    Our Mechanical Engineering department has been planned on modern lines with state-of-the art facilities to be utilized for training of students. This department produces industry ready diploma engineers. The department is equipped with state of the art laboratories and workshops to ensure that students learn the practical aspects of engineering.
                    
                   
               
                    Candidates with Diploma get job opportunities in Government sector offices, Automative Industry, Heavy machinery, Production, Sales in workshops, Garages etc, Companies like Voltas, ACC Ltd, BOSCH, TATA Motors, Mahindra, Hindustan Unilever Ltd., Infotech, Maruti Suzuki etc hire Diploma engineers for roles in manufacturing quality, procurement sales etc.</P>

                   <p style="font-size: 25px;">ndia has set itself an ambitious target of increasing the contribution of manufacturing output to 25 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2025 from less then 16 percent currently. With the focus on “Make in India”. India is slated to emerge as the global manufacturing hub. Which will lead to a lot of opportunities for mechanical engineers, who with breadth of their knowledge will get a variety of career options.</p>
