 <p style="font-size: 25px;color:red; font-style: oblique;">Electrical engineers design, develop, and test electrical equipment. The broad field of electrical engineering involves working with all manners of electronic devices, from pocket calculators to supercomputers. Often overlapping with computer engineering, a college degree in electrical engineering can open up the door to a technical career in almost any industry. Since technology is always changing and expanding, the need for electrical engineers is always growing.</P>
                  
                    <p style="font-size: 25px;color:red;  font-style: oblique;">Like any other kind of scientist, electrical engineers must also know how to communicate their ideas to others in their field. A successful electrical engineer possesses not only an understanding of his area of concentration, but also a broad grasp of engineering in general. This is why most electrical engineering degree programs begin with the fundamentals of engineering itself. Once the student has mastered these fundamentals, she can start to focus on a specialty..</p>
                   
                    <p style="font-size: 25px;color:red;  font-style: oblique;">Electrical engineering students learn through a combination of design and lab work. This mix of theory and practical application allows students to think things through and then apply their ideas in a variety of real life situations. Students also learn to diagnose problems and develop a variety of solutions.</p>
